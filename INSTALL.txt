GENERAL Configuration (mandatory in any case)
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Activate Apache mod_rewrite module.

2. Copy into the public HTML directory of the web server the html/.htaccess 
   file and the html/config directory.

3. Edit .htaccess file to configure RewriteBase parameter. In a URL like this:
   http://server/schoolname/moodle, RewriteBase must be "/".

4. Rename config/config-dist.php to config.php and edit all the 
   $agora['xx']['xx'] vars. Each parameter has a comment (//) at the end of the 
   line explaining its purpose.

5. Rename config/env-config-dist.php to env-config.php and edit all the 
   $agora['xx']['xx'] vars as in step 4.

6. Rename config/config-restricted-dist.php to config-restricted.php and edit 
   all the $agora['xx']['xx'] vars as in step 4.



MOODLE Installation
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy into the public HTML directory of the web server the html/moodle 
   directory.

2. Set the permissions of moodledata directory. It should be readable AND 
   WRITEABLE by the web server user (tipically 'nobody' or 'apache'), but it 
   should not be accessible directly via the web (that's why it's out of the 
   html directory).

3. Create empty databases named usu1, usu2, usu3 and usu4 (4 Moodles). Please
   note that 'usu' is the prefix specified in $agora['moodle']['username'] 
   in config/config.php file, followed by a number (1 for the first Moodle, 
   2 for the second...). That means if it is defined 
   $agora['moodle']['username']='agora', database names must be agora1, 
   agora2 and so on. 

4. Rename moodle/config-dist.php to moodle/config.php. Edit param INSTALL_BASE
   according to server configuration.

7. Access to each instance through the following URL: 
     http://[$agora['server']['html']]/$agora['server']['base']/[$agora['moodle']['username']]XX/moodle
     For example: http://localhost/agora/usu1/moodle
   Moodle will show the install script, where all tables will be set.



ZIKULA Installation
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy into the public HTML directory of the web server the html/zikula 
   directory.

2. Create MySQL database 'usu1' with collation 'utf8_general_ci'.

3. Import sql/intranet_usu1.sql into database usu1.

4. Make directory zkdata/usu1 and all its sudirectories writable by web 
   server.

5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for usu2, usu3 and usu4


Note: Access to intranets can be done with admin - agora.



WORDPRESS Installation
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy into the public HTML directory of the web server the html/wordpress
   directory.

2. Create MySQL database 'usu1' with collation 'utf8_general_ci'.

3. Import sql/masterxxx.sql into database usu1 (xxx specifies the template: pri for
Primary School, sec for Secondary School and cfa for Adults Education). Before
importing it you'll need to open and replace "http://pwc-int.educacio.intranet/agora/masterpri/"
to "http://yourserver/pathtoyourwordpressinstallation/".

4. Make directory wpdata/usu1 and all its sudirectories writable by web server.
Copy the content of sql/masterxxx.zip and unzip it (it contains the initial files
for the template)

5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for usu2, usu3 and usu4


Note: Access to WordPress can be done with admin - agora.



PORTAL Installation
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy into the public HTML directory of the web server the html/portal 
   directory.

2. Create MySQL database 'adminagora' with collation 'utf8_general_ci'.

3. Import sql/adminagora.sql into database adminagora.

4. Make directory portaldata and all its sudirectories writable by web 
   server.


Note: Access to service manager app (http://agora/agora/portal) is done 
   with username 'admin' and password 'agora'.
