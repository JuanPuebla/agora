Content module for the Zikula Application Framework
===================================================

Content is a hierarchical page editing module for Zikula. With it you can insert and edit
various content items, such as HTML texts, videos, maps and much more. Also content of 
other modules and blocks can be shown inside a Content page. 

Each page has a specific layout - e.g. single column, two or three columns, with and
without headers and footers.

* Content 4.5.0 will be jQuery based and will have Bootstrap layout templates to be compatible with Zikula 1.4
* Content 5.0.0 will be Doctrine2 based, so that it is fully native in Zikula 1.4 and beyond
