Folder Structure by default:
---------------------------

--root
	--modules
		--Downloads
	--pnTemp
		--downloads_cache
		--downloads_screenshots
		--downloads_upload

You can now place the folders where ever you want.
For instace you can create a folder called upload one level above the webroot and put the three Downloads folders in it.

In this case you have to use the following path names in the modules configuration

../upload/downloads_upload/
../upload/downloads_screenshots/
../upload/downloads_cache/


Installation:
-------------

 - copy the module folder to your PostNuke root directory onto your server
 - in the administration of postnuke choosen Modules --> Regenerate
 - Initialize and activate Downloads 2.4
 - Make your settings in the administration of the module


IMPORTANT:
----------

Before you start the upgrade make sure you delete all .htaccess files under your upload folder of CmodsDownload or Updownload.
All means all htaccess files in all subfolders of your upload folder!

Upgrade:
--------

 - remove the old Downloads folder from your server (Downloads 1.31 only!)
 - copy the new Downloads folder to your PostNuke modules directory onto your server
 - in the administration of PostNuke choosen Modules --> Regenerate --> and upgrade the module


Folder Permissions:
-------------------
 
 - set the permissions of the following folders to chmod 777

	--downloads_cache
	--downloads_screenshots
	--downloads_upload


If you delete the module all tables in the database will be deleted !!!!!!!!!!


Place Upload folder outside the webroot:
----------------------------------------


To place the folder outside your webroot use ../../pnTemp/downloads_upload/
Each ../ will move the folder one level up!
